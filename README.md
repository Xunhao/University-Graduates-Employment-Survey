# University-Graduates-Employment-Survey

## Goal of this project 
This project consists of simple analysis of how employment rates and average salaries have changed in the past 5 years for students graduating from Accountancy and Business courses. However, the analysis are limited to NTU, NUS, and SMU.

## Dataset
Within the dataset, you will find many other degrees on top of Accountancy and Business. For this project, I have chose to focus on only the aforementioned degrees. 
There are two reasons for this:
1) Majority of the work for this project revolved around manipulating strings. This is because there are cases where a degree in 2013 was named differently than that of 2017. As such, in order for the trend to make sense, we must ensure they are named the same. Having to do it for all the degrees might prove to be too much work.

2) As a graduating business student from NTU, I have a vested interest in knowing how the prospects have changed in terms of employment and average salary. Additionally, I am also interested to know where NTU stand as compared to its counterpart.
